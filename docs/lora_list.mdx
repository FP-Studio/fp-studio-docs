# LoRAs

A LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a set of weights which are trained on top of a base model using supplementary data. This technique can be used to create LoRAs which apply coherent cinematic styles, camera movements, facial expressions, faces, characters, and other concepts to a base diffusion / animation model.

_Note_: Special thanks to contrinsan for providing this data!
